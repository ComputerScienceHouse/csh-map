# CSH Map
An internal site that of RIT's [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu) that shows the occupants of each room on floor, both Nathaniel Rochester Hall and Helen Fish Hall. It's hosted on OpenShift, built using Flask, and it pulls directly from CSH's LDAP, so it'll show future occupants of rooms automagically, with no hard-coding necessary.
